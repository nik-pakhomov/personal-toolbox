PhotoSwipe is simple image gallery that can be used in any web project. It`s written on pure JS, have no dependencies, have support of touch actions (will be useful for mobile devices).

I used it on [this site](https://alena-pakhomova.github.io/pages/work.html) - click on some image at the bottom of the page to see PhotoSwipe gallery.
